You can now use the new [Workers Metrics dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers/services/view/:worker/production/metrics/) to compare metrics across Worker versions, understand the current state of a [gradual deployment](/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/), and review key Workers metrics in a single view, including:

* Total Invocations
* Subrequests from a Worker
* Errors, grouped by Version and Invocation Status
* Execution-related latency, including CPU time and Wall time for the invocation
* Request duration, highlighting the benefits of [Smart Placement](/workers/configuration/smart-placement/)
